# Backend Engineering For Frontend Engineers

This is a live demo that accompanied [this slide deck](https://www.canva.com/design/DAD5pVFil_A/sq7dH-8gDwDxqBkijymjqA/view)
in a presentation called `Backend Engineering For Frontend Engineers`.

The goal was to give a very general overview of the entire picture of backend development, tools, and mentality.
I added loads of comments to `app.js` and `Dockerfile`, which hopefully prove helpful...enjoy!
